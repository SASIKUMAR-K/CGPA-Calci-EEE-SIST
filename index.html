			<div class="aboutMeDiscription">
				I am Sasikumar, currently pursuing a B.E. in EEE at Sathyabama Institute
				of Science and Technology. I have a keen interest in the field of IT. I
				have acquired knowledge in various areas of Python programming,
				including object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and
				various modules such as Tkinter for application development, Flask for
				web development, and modules for connecting to databases like MySQL and
				MongoDB. Additionally, I have experience in C and C++ programming
				languages. In terms of web development, I am familiar with HTML, CSS,
				and JavaScript basics. I possess strong technical skills and exhibit
				perseverance when faced with system issues or code errors, as I am
				dedicated to resolving them. Currently, I am focusing on learning more
				about MongoDB as part of my studies in the IT sector.

			<p>About This WebPage</p>
			<div class="aboutWebPageDiscription">
				This webpage has been developed by me specifically for the Department of
				Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Sathyabama University. It is
				designed to calculate CGPA and GPA for our department's students. Please
				note that this webpage is intended for internal use within our
				department and is not applicable to other colleges or departments. If
				you encounter any bugs or issues while using the webpage, I kindly
				request you to report them to me. You can find my contact details in the
				'Contact' section of the webpage. I assure you that I will promptly
				address any bugs and resolve them accordingly.

			<p>About CGPA and GPA</p>
			<div class="aboutGpaDiscription">
				GPA stands for Grade Point Average, while CGPA stands for Cumulative
				Grade Point Average. The typical range for both GPA and CGPA is from 0.0
				to 10.0. GPA is calculated for a single semester and represents the
				average grade points earned during that specific semester only. On the
				other hand, CGPA is a cumulative measure that considers the overall
				performance up to a particular semester, including the grades and
				credits earned in all previous semesters. For example, when calculating
				the GPA for the third semester, only the marks obtained in courses of
				the third semester are considered. However, when calculating CGPA for
				the third semester, marks from all previous semesters (semester 1,
				semester 2, and semester 3) are taken into account. The formulas for
				both GPA and CGPA involve calculating the ratio of the sum of all grade
				points multiplied by the credits to the sum of all credits. It's
				important to understand what credits are and how to determine them for
				each course. If you need assistance with this, you mentioned that you
				have created a video explaining how to calculate CGPA and GPA, including
				finding credits. I recommend referring to that video for a clear
				understanding of the process.
